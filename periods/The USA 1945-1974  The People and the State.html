            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>The landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, decided on May 17, 1954, declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional, overturning the "separate but equal" doctrine established by the Plessy v. Ferguson decision in 1896. The ruling marked a significant victory for the civil rights movement and paved the way for desegregation in public education and other areas of American life.</p>

The boycott, led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Montgomery Improvement Association, lasted for 381 days and ultimately resulted in the desegregation of the city's public transportation system.</p>
